# SocialMedia

A backend I created in .Net 6 to showcase my proficiency in the framework.

Endpoints implemented base social media functionality, such as:
  User authentication with Jwt tokens
  Authentication to access most endpoints
  user registration
  sending/canceling/rejecting/accepting friend request
  creating/editing/deleting posts
  commenting/liking posts of friends
  deleteing comments
